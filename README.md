# FeedBack-App

  ##  For creating a new React project.
     npx create-react-app feedback-app --use-npm
     

   
  ## Starts the development server.
     npm start
    
  ## Bundles the app into static files for production.
     npm run build
   
  ##  Starts the test runner.
     npm test
  
 ##   Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
 ##     and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
     npm run eject


I suggest that you begin by typing:

     cd feedback-app
     npm start
