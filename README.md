# FeedBack-App
  npx create-react-app feedback-app --use-npm
    For creating a new React project. 

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

I suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd feedback-app
  npm start

Happy hacking!
